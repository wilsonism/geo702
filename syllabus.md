## I. Course Description

Contemporary geographic concepts and theories are examined with emphasis on concepts within human geography.

## II. Learning Objectives

This course is designed to operate in tension with a disciplinary priority on *the history* of geographic thought. As such, weekly discussions will center on a single book, as an access point into the consistencies and contradictions in contemporary geographic debate. This course is designed to help students:
* Engage in discussions about geographic scholarship,
* Trace geographic thought within recent geographic studies,
* Write critical and informed analyses of entire texts, and
* Practice independent research in order to situate geographic ideas.

## III. Format

This course will be composed entirely of seminar discussions.

## IV. Required Texts

There are 12 required books for this course. Please plan ahead. Contact the instructor if you have difficulty accessing any book.

## V. Assignments, Activities, and Grading

### Assessment overview.

Students will be assessed in this course using a variety of methods. Participation in and preparations for seminar are fundamental to successful completion of the course. Assessment is distributed in the following ways, for a total of 100 points:
* Class participation and preparedness (40 points)
* Reaction paper 1 (15 points)
* Reaction paper 2 (15 points)
* Final paper (30 points)

Final grades will be based on a standard scale, i.e., A=90-100%; B=80-89%; C=70-79%; D=60-69%; E=less than 60%. Grades for all assignments will be available via the University of Kentucky Canvas system (http://uk.instructure.com).

### Class participation and preparedness.

Each week, students will be asked to volunteer to lead our discussions, and these students will coordinate their plans with the instructor. We will use the Canvas discussion board to share questions and resources. Schedule extended time to read the weekly assigned books. Prepare your contributions to our seminars in the form of questions and clarifications, ruminations on selected passages, and select additional material to share in the course of our discussions. This is a rare commons that marks the beginning of your graduate study. Therefore, **everyone should contribute to seminar discussions**. If you find this to be difficult, please schedule time to speak with the instructor.

### Reaction papers.

There are two reaction papers. These papers should be around five pages, double-spaced, and focus on a single book. Each paper should address the following questions:
1. What is the argument of the book? (How might you summarize the book? How might this book relate to other readings in previous weeks?)
2. What evidence is provided to support the argument? (How is the argument constructed? What problem does the book seek to address?)
3. What are the limits to the argument?
4. What are the strengths of the argument?
5. What is the significance of this book (as a book)?

### Final paper.

The final paper must be submitted by the scheduled due date for full-credit. The paper should be around 15 pages (no more than 20 pages), double-spaced, and examine a single book from the seminar in greater detail, using additional, supplementary reading. A 250-word abstract will be due in advance that will be shared with the entire class.

## VI. Important Notices

### Prepare for this course.

Review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. If you have questions about course expectations as overviewed by this syllabus, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

### Attend class.

Attendance is not taken nor required, however, note that:
1. the majority of your grade depends on your preparation for, and engagement in, seminar;
2. your success in pushing your disciplinary knowledge largely depends on the effort you apply to supplement the assigned readings with further reading;
3. in the event of an absence, you should consult the syllabus and your peers regarding discussions you have missed.

Students need to notify the professor of absences prior to class in writing (or within one week after the absence). S.R. 5.2.4.2 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences: (a) serious illness, (b) illness or death of family member, (c) University-related trips, (d) major religious holidays, and (e) other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for nonattendance” by the professor.

Students anticipating an absence for a major religious holiday are responsible for notifying the instructor in writing of anticipated absences due to their observance of such holidays no later than the last day in the semester to add a class. Information regarding dates of major religious holidays may be obtained through the religious liaison, Mr. Jake Karnes (859-257-2754). Students are expected to withdraw from the class if more than 20% of the classes scheduled for the semester are missed (excused or unexcused) per university policy.

Students may be asked to verify their absences in order for them to be considered excused. Senate Rule 5.2.4.2 states that faculty have the right to request “appropriate verification” when students claim an excused absence because of illness or death in the family. Appropriate notification of absences due to university-related trips is required prior to the absence.

### Be in contact.

You are responsible for checking your UKY email account; the class listserv is what will be used to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact the instructor (place ‘GEO702’ in the subject heading). Please allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. The instructor will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others.

Students are strongly encouraged to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to facilitate the objectives of this seminar.

### Ask before recording.

Video and audio recordings are not permitted during our class meetings unless the student has received prior permission from the instructors. If permission is granted, recording of other students is prohibited. Any distribution of recordings is also probhibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor. All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures are the intellectual property of the instructors and cannot be reproduced, sold, or used for any purpose other than educational work in this class without prior permission from the instructor.

### Get help.

If you are having difficulty with any course material, please contact the instructor. There are also other resources which you should find useful:
* [Pauer Center for Cartography & GIS](https://geography.as.uky.edu/cartlab) in Miller Hall 5
* [The University Writing Center](https://uky.mywconline.com)
* [Map Collections](http://libguides.uky.edu/maps), Science Library in King Library 410C
* [Stress Management Workshops](http://www.uky.edu/counselingcenter/student-services) in Frazee Hall

### Meet deadlines.

Meeting deadlines is an important professional practice. Consult the course schedule, below, for the due dates of the course assignments. A 10-percent deduction will be applied to the final score of your assignment for submissions after the deadline on the same calendar day, with an additional 10-percent deduction for each additional calendar day the assignment is late. If the assignment is not delivered by the next class meeting, the assignment will not be accepted.

### Be honest.

This course, if successful, will expose you to a variety of concepts. You are expected to draw upon these various ideas, but you must be transparent and honest about your use of these ideas. Please get help if you’re uncertain about this expectation! Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students are expected to adhere to University policy on cheating and plagiarism in all courses. The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or the student has other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to suspension from the university may be imposed.

Plagiarism and cheating are serious breaches of academic conduct. Each student is advised to become familiar with the various forms of academic dishonesty as explained in the **Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities**. Complete information can be found at the following website: http://www.uky.edu/Ombud. A plea of ignorance is not acceptable as a defense against the charge of academic dishonesty. It is important that you review this information as all ideas borrowed from others need to be properly credited.

Part II of **Student Rights and Responsibilities** (available at http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Code/part2.html) states that all academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research, or self-expression. In cases where students feel unsure about the question of plagiarism involving their own work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission.

When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording or anything else from another source without appropriate acknowledgement of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism. Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else’s work, whether it be a published article, chapter of a book, a paper from a friend or some file, or something similar to this. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as his/her own, whoever that other person may be.

Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, but when the actual work is done, it must be done by the student, and the student alone. When a student’s assignment involves research in outside sources of information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where and how he/she employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these *Rules* shall apply to those ideas which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain (Section 6.3.1).

**Please note:** Any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.

### Be respectful.

Students should at all times be respectful of fellow students, the professor or teaching assistant(s), and the University of Kentucky. Some basic reminders:
* Silence all mobile devices.
* Show up on time. Late arrivals (and unnecessary) early departures are rude and disruptive.
* Put away your reading material (other than materials necessary for the lecture/course).
* Talking and whispering during class is disrespectful to the professor and fellow students and makes it more difficult for those who want to learn to do so.
* Be attentive to and respectful of other students’ contributions to class discussions. Discussion must not include attacks of a personal nature, including denigrating another on the basis of skin color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, national/regional origin or other such irrelevant factors.

### For students with special needs:

If you have a documented disability that requires academic accommodations, please see me as soon as possible during scheduled office hours. In order to receive accommodations in this course, you must provide me with a Letter of Accommodation from the Disability Resource Center (725 Rose Street, Suite 407 Multidisciplinary Science Building, 8AM to 4:30PM, 859-257-2754, email address: jkarnes@email.uky.edu) for coordination of campus disability services available to students with disabilities.
