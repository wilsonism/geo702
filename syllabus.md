## I. Course Description

Contemporary geographic concepts and theories are examined with emphasis on concepts within human geography.

## II. Learning Objectives

This course is designed to operate in tension with a disciplinary priority on *the history* of geographic thought. As such, weekly discussions will center on a concept in geography, as illustrated through key interventions and debates in the literature. This course is designed to help students:
* Engage in discussions about geographic scholarship,
* Trace geographic thought within recent geographic studies,
* Write critical and informed analyses of texts, and
* Practice independent research in order to situate geographic ideas.

## III. Format

This course will be composed entirely of seminar discussions. These discussions will occur in-person or, infrequently as necessary, via Zoom.

## IV. Required Texts

There are several required articles and book chapters for this course (nearly 100 citations), and students are encouraged to utilize UK Libraries (including ILL) to access these course materials. Students should contact the instructor if they have difficulty accessing any text.

## V. Assignments, Activities, and Grading

### Assessment overview.

Students will be assessed in this course using a variety of methods. Participation in and preparations for seminar are fundamental to successful completion of the course. Assessment is distributed in the following ways, for a total of 100 points:
* Participation and preparedness (40 points)
* Reaction essays (30 points)
* Final paper (30 points)

Final grades will be based on a standard scale, i.e., A=90-100%; B=80-89%; C=70-79%; D=60-69%; E=less than 60%. Grades for all assignments will be available via the University of Kentucky Canvas system (http://uk.instructure.com).

### Participation and preparedness.

As a required course for all entering graduate students, this course is meant to accompany the variety of activities that help students engage in department and College life. Each week, students will be asked to prepare to engage in seminar discussions and take an active role in these discussions: including asking questions, articulating their understanding of the texts, and make connections to other students’ ideas and to other texts of the course. Students will also attend department colloquia and other activities meant to help new students connect with the department. We will use Canvas to remind students of activities and provide discussion boards to share questions and resources. Students should plan to schedule extended time to read the weekly assigned texts. Students should prepare contributions to seminars in the form of questions and clarifications, ruminations on selected passages, and select additional material to share in the course of our discussions. All students should contribute to seminar discussions. If students find this to be difficult, they should schedule time to speak with the instructor.

### Reaction essays.

There will be multiple reaction essays as assigned by the instructor. Some of these will be short responses that are assigned, handwritten, and collected during seminar. Others will be assigned as homework and should be less than two-pages, doubled spaced, with proper attributions of source material.

### Final paper.

The final paper must be submitted by the scheduled due date for full-credit. The paper should be around 15 pages (no more than 20 pages), double-spaced, and examine a single concept from the seminar in greater detail, using additional, supplementary reading. A 250-word abstract will be due in advance that will be shared with the entire class.

## VI. Important Notices

### Prepare for this course.

Students should review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. If students have questions about course expectations as overviewed by this syllabus, they should contact the instructor as soon as possible.

### Attend class.

Attendance is not taken nor required, however, note that:
1. the majority of a student’s grade depends on their preparation for, and engagement in, seminar;
2. student success in pushing their disciplinary knowledge largely depends on the effort they apply to supplement the assigned readings with further reading;
3. in the event of an absence, students should consult the syllabus and their peers regarding discussions they have missed.

### Be in contact.

Students are responsible for checking their UKY email account; Canvas is what will be used to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact the instructor. Students should allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. The instructor will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others.

Students are strongly encouraged to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to facilitate the objectives of this studio.

### Get permission before recording.

Meetings of this course may be recorded. All video and audio recordings of lecturers and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this class only. They are available only through the Canvas shell for this course and are not to be copied, shared, or redistributed.

The University of Kentucky Student Code of Conduct defines Invasion of Privacy as using electronic or other devices to make a photographic, audio, or video record of any person without their prior knowledge or consent when such a recording is likely to cause injury or distress. As addressed in the Student Code of Conduct, students are expected to follow appropriate university policies and maintain the security of linkblue accounts used to access recorded class materials. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.

If the instructor or a University of Kentucky office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent prior to such use. In anticipation of such cases, students may be asked to complete an “authorization of use” form by a faculty member.

Video and audio recordings by students are not permitted during the class unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. Any sharing, distribution, and or uploading of these recordings outside of the parameters of the class is prohibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor.

All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures are the intellectual property of the instructors and cannot be reproduced or sold without prior permission from the instructors. A student may use the material for reasonable educational and professional purposes extending beyond this class, such as studying for a comprehensive or qualifying examination in a degree program, preparing for a professional or certification examination, or to assist in fulfilling responsibilities at a job or internship.

### Get help.

If students are having difficulty with any course material, please contact the instructor. There are also other resources which students might find useful:
* Pauer Center for Cartography & GIS in Miller Hall 5, https://geography.as.uky.edu/cartlab
* The University Writing Center, https://uky.mywconline.com
* Map Collections, Science Library in King Library 410C, http://libguides.uky.edu/maps
* Counseling Center, https://www.uky.edu/counselingcenter/student-services

### Meet deadlines.

Meeting deadlines is an important professional practice. Students should consult the course schedule, below, for the due dates of the course assignments. A 10-percent deduction will be applied to the final score of an assignment for submissions after the deadline on the same calendar day, with an additional 10-percent deduction for each additional calendar day the assignment is late. If the assignment is not delivered by the next class meeting, the assignment will not be accepted.

### Be honest.

This course, if successful, will expose students to a variety of concepts and techniques. Students are expected to draw upon these various ideas, but they must be transparent and honest about their use of these ideas. Students should get help if they are uncertain about this expectation. Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students should familiarize themselves with policies regarding Academic Offenses (available at https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/ao). Please note: Any assignment students turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.

### Be respectful.

Students should at all times be respectful of fellow students, the professor or teaching assistant(s), and the University of Kentucky. Some basic reminders:
* Silence all mobile devices.
* Show up on time. Late arrivals (and unnecessary) early departures are rude and disruptive.
* Put away your reading material (other than materials necessary for the lecture/course).
* Talking and whispering during class is disrespectful to the professor and fellow students and makes it more difficult for those who want to learn to do so.
* Be attentive to and respectful of other students’ contributions to class discussions. Discussion must not include attacks of a personal nature, including denigrating another on the basis of skin color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, national/regional origin or other such irrelevant factors.

### Renew your commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The University of Kentucky is committed to our core values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and human dignity, and a sense of community (Governing Regulations XIV, available at [https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). We acknowledge and respect the seen and unseen diverse identities and experiences of all members of the university community ([https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). These identities include but are not limited to those based on race, ethnicity, gender identity and expressions, ideas and perspectives, religious and cultural beliefs, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ability, and socioeconomic status. We are committed to equity and justice and providing a learning and engaging community in which every member is engaged, heard, and valued.

We strive to rectify and change behavior that is inconsistent with our principles and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. If students encounter such behavior in a course, they are encouraged to speak with the instructor of record and/or the Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity (available at [https://www.uky.edu/eeo/](https://www.uky.edu/eeo/)). Students may also contact a faculty member within the department, program director, the director of undergraduate or graduate studies, the department chair, any college administrator, or the dean. All of these individuals are mandatory reporters under University policies.

### Familiarize yourself with campus-wide policies.

To learn more about campus-wide policies on Excused Absences and Acceptable Excuses, Religious Observances, Verification of Absences, Make-Up Work, Excused Absences for Military Duties, Unexcused Absences, Prep Week and Reading Days, Accommodation Due to Disability, Non-Discrimination Statement and Title IX Information, students should refer to Academic Policy Statements (available at [https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/acadpolicy](https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/acadpolicy)). Students should contact the instructor with any questions regarding these policies.
