## I. Course Description

Contemporary geographic concepts and theories are examined with emphasis on concepts within human geography.

## II. Learning Objectives

This course is designed to operate in tension with a disciplinary priority on *the history* of geographic thought. As such, weekly discussions will center on a single book, as an access point into the consistencies and contradictions in contemporary geographic debate. This course is designed to help students:
* Engage in discussions about geographic scholarship,
* Trace geographic thought within recent geographic studies,
* Write critical and informed analyses of entire texts, and
* Practice independent research in order to situate geographic ideas.

## III. Format

This course will be composed entirely of seminar discussions. These discussions may occur in-person or via Zoom.

## IV. Required Texts

There are 13 required books for this course. Please plan ahead. Contact the instructor if you have difficulty accessing any book.

## V. Assignments, Activities, and Grading

### Assessment overview.

Students will be assessed in this course using a variety of methods. Participation in and preparations for seminar are fundamental to successful completion of the course. Assessment is distributed in the following ways, for a total of 100 points:
* Class participation and preparedness (40 points)
* Reaction paper 1 (15 points)
* Reaction paper 2 (15 points)
* Final paper (30 points)

Final grades will be based on a standard scale, i.e., A=90-100%; B=80-89%; C=70-79%; D=60-69%; E=less than 60%. Grades for all assignments will be available via the University of Kentucky Canvas system (http://uk.instructure.com).

### Class participation and preparedness.

Each week, students will be asked to volunteer to lead our discussions, and these students will coordinate their plans with the instructor. We will use the Canvas discussion board to share questions and resources. Schedule extended time to read the weekly assigned books. Prepare your contributions to our seminars in the form of questions and clarifications, ruminations on selected passages, and select additional material to share in the course of our discussions. This is a rare commons that marks the beginning of your graduate study. Therefore, **everyone should contribute to seminar discussions**. If you find this to be difficult, please schedule time to speak with the instructor.

### Reaction papers.

There are two reaction papers. These papers should be around five pages, double-spaced, and focus on a single book. Each paper should address the following questions:
1. What is the argument of the book? (How might you summarize the book? How might this book relate to other readings in previous weeks?)
2. What evidence is provided to support the argument? (How is the argument constructed? What problem does the book seek to address?)
3. What are the limits to the argument?
4. What are the strengths of the argument?
5. What is the significance of this book (as a book)?

### Final paper.

The final paper must be submitted by the scheduled due date for full-credit. The paper should be around 15 pages (no more than 20 pages), double-spaced, and examine a single book from the seminar in greater detail, using additional, supplementary reading. A 250-word abstract will be due in advance that will be shared with the entire class.

## VI. Important Notices

### Prepare for this course.

Review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. If you have questions about course expectations as overviewed by this syllabus, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

### Attend class.

Attendance is not taken nor required, however, note that:
1. the majority of your grade depends on your preparation for, and engagement in, seminar;
2. your success in pushing your disciplinary knowledge largely depends on the effort you apply to supplement the assigned readings with further reading;
3. in the event of an absence, you should consult the syllabus and your peers regarding discussions you have missed.

### Wear a mask.

In accordance with University guidelines, students must wear UK-approved face coverings in the classroom and academic buildings (e.g., faculty offices, laboratories, libraries, performance/design studios, and common study areas where students might congregate). If UK-approved face coverings are not worn over the nose and mouth, students will be asked to leave the classroom.

### Be in contact.

You are responsible for checking your UKY email account; Canvas is what will be used to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact the instructor. Please allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. The instructor will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others.

Students are strongly encouraged to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to facilitate the objectives of this studio.

### Get permission before recording.

Meetings of this course may be recorded. All video and audio recordings of lecturers and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this class only. They are available only through the Canvas shell for this course and are not to be copied, shared, or redistributed.

The University of Kentucky Student Code of Conduct defines Invasion of Privacy as using electronic or other devices to make a photographic, audio, or video record of any person without their prior knowledge or consent when such a recording is likely to cause injury or distress. As addressed in the Student Code of Conduct, students are expected to follow appropriate university policies and maintain the security of linkblue accounts used to access recorded class materials. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.

If the instructor or a University of Kentucky office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent prior to such use. In anticipation of such cases, students may be asked to complete an “authorization of use” form by a faculty member.

Video and audio recordings by students are not permitted during the class unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. Any sharing, distribution, and or uploading of these recordings outside of the parameters of the class is prohibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor.

All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures are the intellectual property of the instructors and cannot be reproduced or sold without prior permission from the instructors. A student may use the material for reasonable educational and professional purposes extending beyond this class, such as studying for a comprehensive or qualifying examination in a degree program, preparing for a professional or certification examination, or to assist in fulfilling responsibilities at a job or internship.

### Get help.

If you are having difficulty with any course material, please contact the instructor. There are also other resources which you might find useful:
* Pauer Center for Cartography & GIS in Miller Hall 5, https://geography.as.uky.edu/cartlab
* The University Writing Center, https://uky.mywconline.com
* Map Collections, Science Library in King Library 410C, http://libguides.uky.edu/maps
* Counseling Center, https://www.uky.edu/counselingcenter/student-services

### Meet deadlines.

Meeting deadlines is an important professional practice. Consult the course schedule, below, for the due dates of the course assignments. A 10-percent deduction will be applied to the final score of your assignment for submissions after the deadline on the same calendar day, with an additional 10-percent deduction for each additional calendar day the assignment is late. If the assignment is not delivered by the next class meeting, the assignment will not be accepted.

### Be honest.

This course, if successful, will expose you to a variety of concepts and techniques. You are expected to draw upon these various ideas, but you must be transparent and honest about your use of these ideas. Please get help if you are uncertain about this expectation! Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students should familiarize themselves with policies regarding Academic Offenses (available at https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/ao). **Please note:** Any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.

### Be respectful.

Students should at all times be respectful of fellow students, the professor or teaching assistant(s), and the University of Kentucky. Some basic reminders:
* Silence all mobile devices.
* Show up on time. Late arrivals (and unnecessary) early departures are rude and disruptive.
* Put away your reading material (other than materials necessary for the lecture/course).
* Talking and whispering during class is disrespectful to the professor and fellow students and makes it more difficult for those who want to learn to do so.
* Be attentive to and respectful of other students’ contributions to class discussions. Discussion must not include attacks of a personal nature, including denigrating another on the basis of skin color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, national/regional origin or other such irrelevant factors.

### Renew your commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The University of Kentucky is committed to our core values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and human dignity, and a sense of community (Governing Regulations XIV, available at [https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). We acknowledge and respect the seen and unseen diverse identities and experiences of all members of the university community ([https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). These identities include but are not limited to those based on race, ethnicity, gender identity and expressions, ideas and perspectives, religious and cultural beliefs, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ability, and socioeconomic status. We are committed to equity and justice and providing a learning and engaging community in which every member is engaged, heard, and valued.

We strive to rectify and change behavior that is inconsistent with our principles and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. If students encounter such behavior in a course, they are encouraged to speak with the instructor of record and/or the Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity (available at [https://www.uky.edu/eeo/](https://www.uky.edu/eeo/)). Students may also contact a faculty member within the department, program director, the director of undergraduate or graduate studies, the department chair, any college administrator, or the dean. All of these individuals are mandatory reporters under University policies.
