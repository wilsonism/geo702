## I. Course Description

Contemporary geographic concepts and theories are examined with emphasis on concepts within human geography, especially with reference to the economic, urban, cultural, and population subfields within the discipline.

## II. Learning Objectives

This course will expose students to the technical, critical, and collaborative skills necessary to analyze a range of human and environmental phenomena using tools of geographic representation. The studio model will allow students to develop and apply these skills in partnership with community organizations. This course is designed to help students:
* Extend their skills in digital data preparation and handling in a mapping environment,
* Gain experience across the full range of steps and tasks that comprise GIS applications,
* Practice skills that will help them navigate partnerships in mapping work,
* Become an independent and ethical mapmaker who is prepared to work in a diversity of institutional, geographical, and political contexts, and
* Produce an applied mapping project from start to finish that may be used to showcase their cartographic and GIS abilities to future employers or academic programs.

## III. Format

This course will be composed entirely of studio sessions, which may involve some skill sharing, technical demonstrations, and guest speakers from the community. There will be in-class and extensive out-of-class assignments, and part of students’ assessments will be based on their observational and data collection work ‘in the field’. In our studio sessions, students will be expected to work constructively with their fellow classmates and visiting community partners.

## IV. Required Texts

While there are no required texts for this course, materials will be made available to students as necessary for the development of the studio projects. Students will be encouraged to conduct their own literature search and annotation for sharing with the studio.

## V. Assignments, Activities, and Grading

### Assessment overview.

Students will be assessed in this course using a variety of methods. Attendance and participation in studio is fundamental to successful completion of the course. Assessment is distributed in the following ways, for a total of 350 points:
* [Site analysis](site-analysis/README.md) (30 points)
* Technology demonstration (20 points)
* Midterm review (100 points)
* Final review (100 points)
* Final report (50 points)
* Class participation (50 points)

Final grades will be based on a standard scale, i.e., A=90-100%; B=80-89%; C=70-79%; D=60-69%; E=less than 60%. Grades for all assignments will be available via the University of Kentucky Canvas system (http://uk.instructure.com).

### Site analysis.

To jump-start the studio, students will complete an initial site analysis of the study area using GIS, to include primary and secondary spatial data. Analysis should highlight and prioritize more formal lines of inquiry that will be pursued throughout the semester, with an identification of potential community partners that could be engaged during the studio. Students are encouraged to use QGIS and/or ArcGIS.

### Technology demonstration.

During the first few weeks of the semester, student pairs will sign-up for, prepare, and lead a technology demonstration during, or immediately following, the completion of their site analyses. In preparation, students will review the assigned technology and prepare a 10-minute overview and demonstration during studio. A typed, one page (single-spaced) review should answer the following questions (1 per student pair): (1) What are the specific system requirements for this technology? (2) What are the specific capabilities of this technology? (3) What is the brief history of this technology’s development and use? Students should print this review and bring it to studio on the day of the scheduled demonstration.

### Midterm review.

Students will prepare a midterm review as a formalization of work-to-date completed in the studio. Progress will be demonstrated in three areas: (1) more advanced and focused geographic representation from the site analysis, (2) identification of potential community partners and elaboration of specific needs to be addressed, and (3) outline of next steps in refining the analysis, representation, and, as appropriate, the program. Evaluation of the midterm review will occur during class, with invited guest reviewers and community partners. Students with overlapping interests may choose to pair-up for the midterm review, with permission of the instructor.

### Final review.

The final review will need to demonstrate incorporation of feedback from the midterm review and further refinement of the project. Evaluation of the final review will occur during class, with invited guest reviewers and community partners. Students with overlapping interests may choose to pair-up for the final review, with permission of instructor, but **each student** must prepare a final report.

### Final report.

A final report (no more than two-pages, single-spaced, with illustrations included as appendices) should (1) communicate the current state of knowledge regarding the study area, (2) briefly overview the work completed, and (3) discuss the significance of this work and identify further work to be completed. The report may be directed to a specific community partner or organization. Supporting illustrations should be included as appendices in the final report. Delivery of final report should be as a PDF, with a compressed ZIP folder containing all original documents, map files, as well as primary and secondary data. Students are encouraged to submit drafts of the final report for feedback at least one week in advance of the final report deadline.

### Class participation.

While attendance will not be taken, students are expected to attend all scheduled studio sessions. Throughout the semester, desk critiques will be conducted by the instructor and peer students and these ‘desk crits’ will contribute to a final evaluation of class participation.

## VI. Important Notices

### Prepare for this course.

Review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. If you have questions about course expectations as overviewed by this syllabus, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

### Attend class.

Attendance is not taken nor required, however, note that:
1. the majority of your grade depends on your preparation for, and engagement in, studio;
2. your success in pushing your technical knowledge of emerging representational technologies largely depends on the effort you apply in studio;
3. in the event of an absence, you should consult the syllabus and your peers regarding what material you have missed.

Students need to notify the professor of absences prior to class in writing (or within one week after the absence). S.R. 5.2.4.2 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences: (a) serious illness, (b) illness or death of family member, (c) University-related trips, (d) major religious holidays, and (e) other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for nonattendance” by the professor.

Students anticipating an absence for a major religious holiday are responsible for notifying the instructor in writing of anticipated absences due to their observance of such holidays no later than the last day in the semester to add a class. Information regarding dates of major religious holidays may be obtained through the religious liaison, Mr. Jake Karnes (859-257-2754). Students are expected to withdraw from the class if more than 20% of the classes scheduled for the semester are missed (excused or unexcused) per university policy.

Students may be asked to verify their absences in order for them to be considered excused. Senate Rule 5.2.4.2 states that faculty have the right to request “appropriate verification” when students claim an excused absence because of illness or death in the family. Appropriate notification of absences due to university-related trips is required prior to the absence.

### Be in contact.

You are responsible for checking your UKY email account; the class listserv is what will be used to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact the instructor (place ‘GEO509’ in the subject heading). Please allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. The instructor will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others.

Students are strongly encouraged to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to facilitate the objectives of this studio.

### Ask before recording.

Video and audio recordings are not permitted during our class meetings unless the student has received prior permission from the instructors. If permission is granted, recording of other students is prohibited. Any distribution of recordings is also probhibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor. All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures are the intellectual property of the instructors and cannot be reproduced, sold, or used for any purpose other than educational work in this class without prior permission from the instructor.

### Get help.

If you are having difficulty with any course material, please contact the instructor. There are also other resources which you should find useful:
* Pauer Center for Cartography & GIS in Miller Hall 5, https://geography.as.uky.edu/cartlab
* The University Writing Center, https://uky.mywconline.com
* Map Collections, Science Library in King Library 410C, http://libguides.uky.edu/maps
* Stress Management Workshops in Frazee Hall, http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Counseling/
* On reading an academic journal article, http://www.brockport.edu/sociology/journal.html

### Meet deadlines.

Meeting deadlines is an important professional practice. Consult the course schedule, below, for the due dates of the course assignments. A 10-percent deduction will be applied to the final score of your assignment for submissions after the deadline on the same calendar day, with an additional 10-percent deduction for each additional calendar day the assignment is late. If the assignment is not delivered by the next class meeting, the assignment will not be accepted.

### Be honest.

This course, if successful, will expose you to a variety of concepts and techniques. You are expected to draw upon these various ideas, but you must be transparent and honest about your use of these ideas. Please get help if you’re uncertain about this expectation! Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students are expected to adhere to University policy on cheating and plagiarism in all courses. The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or the student has other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to suspension from the university may be imposed.

Plagiarism and cheating are serious breaches of academic conduct. Each student is advised to become familiar with the various forms of academic dishonesty as explained in the **Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities**. Complete information can be found at the following website: http://www.uky.edu/Ombud. A plea of ignorance is not acceptable as a defense against the charge of academic dishonesty. It is important that you review this information as all ideas borrowed from others need to be properly credited.

Part II of **Student Rights and Responsibilities** (available at http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Code/part2.html) states that all academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research, or self-expression. In cases where students feel unsure about the question of plagiarism involving their own work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission.

When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording or anything else from another source without appropriate acknowledgement of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism. Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else’s work, whether it be a published article, chapter of a book, a paper from a friend or some file, or something similar to this. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as his/her own, whoever that other person may be.

Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, but when the actual work is done, it must be done by the student, and the student alone. When a student’s assignment involves research in outside sources of information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where and how he/she employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these *Rules* shall apply to those ideas which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain (Section 6.3.1).

**Please note:** Any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.

### Be respectful.

Students should at all times be respectful of fellow students, the professor or teaching assistant(s), and the University of Kentucky. Some basic reminders:
* Silence all mobile devices.
* Show up on time. Late arrivals (and unnecessary) early departures are rude and disruptive.
* Put away your reading material (other than materials necessary for the lecture/course).
* Talking and whispering during class is disrespectful to the professor and fellow students and makes it more difficult for those who want to learn to do so.
* Be attentive to and respectful of other students’ contributions to class discussions. Discussion must not include attacks of a personal nature, including denigrating another on the basis of skin color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, national/regional origin or other such irrelevant factors.

### For students with special needs:

If you have a documented disability that requires academic accommodations, please see me as soon as possible during scheduled office hours. In order to receive accommodations in this course, you must provide me with a Letter of Accommodation from the Disability Resource Center (725 Rose Street, Suite 407 Multidisciplinary Science Building, 8AM to 4:30PM, 859-257-2754, email address: jkarnes@email.uky.edu) for coordination of campus disability services available to students with disabilities.
